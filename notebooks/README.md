## Overview
This folder contains Jupyter notebooks focused on analyzing solar radiation data from different countries. Each notebook provides a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) for a specific country.

## Files
- `analysis_benin.ipynb`: EDA for solar radiation data in Benin.
- `analysis_sierra_leone.ipynb`: EDA for solar radiation data in Sierra Leone.
- `analysis_togo.ipynb`: EDA for solar radiation data in Togo.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed:
   ```bash
   pip install -r ../requirements.txt
   ```
2. Open the notebook in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab).
